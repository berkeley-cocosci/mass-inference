  rendered video.

## Directories

* [`analysis`](https://github.com/jhamrick/mass-inference/tree/master/analysis):
  Code that involves analysis of human and/or model data, such as
  using model predictions to select stimuli, or evaluating experiment
  data under the model.

* [`experiment`](https://github.com/jhamrick/mass-inference/tree/master/experiment):
  Code to run the experiments.

* [`scripts`](https://github.com/jhamrick/mass-inference/tree/master/scripts):
  Various utility scripts to help generate, view, and manage stimuli and
  data.
