	<p>The Cognitional Cognitive Science Group at the University
	of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) is looking for online
	participants for a brief experiment on how people reason about
	objects.</p>

	<p>In this experiment you will be shown video clips of towers
	of building blocks, and you will judge whether they will fall
	down or not. You will complete 62 trials, which typically
	takes about 15 minutes.</p>

	<p>The requirements are:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>You are at least 18 years old,</li>
	  <li>You are not colorblind,</li>
	  <li>You are a fluent English speaker, and</li>
	  <li>You have not participated in a previous version of this
	  experiment.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note: the experiment should work in recent versions of
	Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, but <span class="warn">it will
	not work in Internet Explorer</span>. You must also have
	JavaScript and Flash enabled.</p>

	<p>This task can only be completed once. If you have already
	completed this task before the system will not allow you to
	run again. If this looks familiar please release the hit so
	someone else can participate.</p>

	Otherwise, please click the "Accept Hit" button on the Amazon
	site above to begin the task.
