    In this experiment, you will be making judgments about towers
    of "stable" and "unstable" building blocks. Stable towers,
    like the following, stay standing:
    
    <div id="stable-example"></div>
  </p>

  <p class="block-text">
    And unstable towers fall down:

    <div id="unstable-example"></div>
