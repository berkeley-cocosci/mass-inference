Mass Inference Analysis
=======================

Code for analyzing people's inferences of the relative mass of objects.

* Selection of stimuli for the CogSci 2013 experiments is in the
  [choose-stability-learning-stimuli](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/jhamrick/mass-inference/master/analysis/choose-stability-learning-stimuli.ipynb)
  notebook.

* Selection of the "diagnostic" ordering in the CogSci 2013
  experiments is in the
  [choose-stability-learning-order-E](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/jhamrick/mass-inference/master/analysis/choose-stability-learning-order-E.ipynb)
  notebook.

* Current analysis of human/model data for CogSci 2013 is in the
  [analyze-stability-learning](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/jhamrick/mass-inference/master/analysis/analyze-stability-learning.ipynb)
  notebook.

Note that the analyze-particle-filter notebook is out of date,
probably doesn't run, and is still in the repository just for
reference.
