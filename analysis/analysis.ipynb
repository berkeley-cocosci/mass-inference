      "We've previously shown that people can make physical predictions that are sensitive to underlying physical attributes in a manner computationall consistent with \"noisy Newton\" and by a mechanism of approximate probabilistic simulation.  Can these same computational and mechanistic accounts also explain how people infer and learn about the underlying physical attributes of scenes? We ran an experiment in which we asked people to make physical predictions and physical inferences, and found they agreed with noisy Newton and approximate probabilistic simulation. We then examined how they learn about physical attributes through experience and found again that their patterns of learning could be explained in similar terms."

Recent research (Sanborn2013) has explained how previous results suggesting people do not make sophisticated inferences about mass (Todd1982, Gilden1994) can be explained using Bayesian inference. However, no one has yet shown whether this also holds true in more complicated, realistic scenes."
