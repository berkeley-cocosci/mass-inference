How do people infer intrinsic attributes of objects, such as mass or
friction, from limited exposure to the complex scenes in which those
objects interact? Previous work has shown that when properties like
mass are known, people can make sophisticated physical predictions,
such as whether a tower of building blocks will fall. We hypothesize
that people leverage this physical knowledge to infer properties like
mass by anticipating what will happen and then updating their beliefs
based on their predictions' divergence from reality. To formalize this
notion, we built a model observer that learns about objects' masses
over time by recruiting approximate physics knowledge into an optimal
learning framework. We showed people towers of heavy and light
building blocks and asked them to predict whether each tower would
fall. After demonstrating whether the tower fell, we asked people to
infer which type of block was heavier. Our results indicate that
people learn the relative masses of the blocks over time, and that
their predictions and inferences are similar to those exhibited by the
model as it learns.
